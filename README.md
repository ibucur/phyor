Phyor WADe Project 

Develop a multi-platform application able to identify various (categories of) physical objects – by using its numerical/graphical symbol/sign (e.g., several types of barcodes) – in order to recommend alternatives of interest for a specific user. These recommendations could depend on many factors: availability in other format (an ePub version of a printed book, the Blu-ray edition instead of DVD), language (i.e. different translations of a given work), price (for example, only expensive luxury products), quality (new vs. used, CD vs. SACD), similarity (other LP of a musical group), user preferences (only bottles and cans having a specific shape/color, food without preservatives and meat). New functionalities will be implemented as extensions (modules) – provide at least 2 new features – i.e. support for actions like sharing a recommended object on a popular social network or saving the URL on Pocket. All significant information will be accessed by a SPARQL endpoint. You can use, among others, Open Food Facts, Wikidata, Virtual International Authority File.
